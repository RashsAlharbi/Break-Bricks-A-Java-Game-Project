## Project Description
The Break Bricks game is an engaging Java project where players aim to break bricks located at the top of the screen. The player controls a small ball positioned on a platform at the bottom of the screen, which can be moved left and right using the arrow keys. The main objective is to break the bricks without letting the ball fall off the platform.

### How to Play
The game consists of three frames:

1. **Frame 1 (Start)**:
   - The first interface contains a text field for the player to enter their name. 
   - If the name field is empty and the player presses the start button, an error message will prompt them to enter their name. 
   - Once the name is entered and the start button is pressed, the game begins. 
   - There is also a button that provides instructions on how to play.

2. **Frame 2 (Break Bricks)**:
   - This is the main gameplay frame.
   - It features a paddle at the bottom, bricks at the top, and a ball that moves around the frame while keeping score.

3. **Frame 3 (How to Play the Game)**:
   - This frame contains instructions on how to play the game.
   - There is a button that allows the player to return to the previous frame.
